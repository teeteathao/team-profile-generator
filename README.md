# Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## Description

Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Usage

When I start the application, I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
After I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team. When I select the engineer option, then I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu. When I select the intern option, then I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.

When I am finish building my team, a HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.

Additionally, when I click on an email address in the HTML, then my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address. When I click on the GitHub username then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.

## Visual

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated HTML’s appearance and functionality:
